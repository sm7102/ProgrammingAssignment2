## Caching the Inverse of a Matrix 
## This will be divided in to 2 functions. 

## This function will create a special matrix which can cache its inverse.
## This is nothing but a list containing following 4 functions,
## 1.  set
## 2.  get
## 3.  setinverse
## 4.  getinverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
	
}


## The following function inversion of the matrix (from makeCacheMatrix function).
## If the inverse has already been calculated and the matrix has not been altered,
## then the function will retrieve the inverse from cache, instead of recalculating.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
